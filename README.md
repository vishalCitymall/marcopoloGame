# why-Not-Node
This is the answer to when not to use node JS.

1. Node JS is based on an event, a driven non-blocking model; hence it doesn't fare with big logic units and high computation power needing tasks.
But when a high CPU is required, Node JS isn't favourable.

2. Node JS is a single-threaded language, and it comes with its benefits and as stated above, if your project requires large CPU power or does the same work for a long-time threaded server might be the way to go.

3. As we all know how much Node JS devs love using Mongo, but as far as SQL goes we do not have good support for that. So, if you require using a relational database as a priority, then Node JS may be the wrong option.

4. Node JS is still new and not easy to maintain because of the unpredictability of Node JS, you might want to avoid using Node JS in an enterprise-level project.

5. Node JS uses JavaScript, and we all know that typescript can also be used. But when it comes to JS it isn't easy to maintain and may cause a lot of headaches if the codebase is big. So we might wanna stick to a strictly defined language like Java, for big codebases.
